# Wantez

Wantez provides means for OSS maintainers to publish bounties on different bugs and features in their projects. Once a user completes a pull request that closes the posted issue, the amount set on the bounty will be transferred to the user. This process should be as automatic as possible.

Bounty prices can be set in tezos and FA1.2/2 tokens.

## Features

The following features will be available:

- Anyone can browse the list of bounties.
- Any registered user can post a bounty
- Any registered user can apply to work on a bounty
- When a PR fixing the issue is merged, the fixing user will be paid for his contribution.

## Business Model

- A fee will be taken from any fixed bug (from the funder, not the contributor).
- For the first version the fee will 0%
